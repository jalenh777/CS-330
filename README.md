1. When I design software, I start by clearly defining what I want the program to accomplish and what features it needs. I break the project down into smaller parts so I can focus on one piece at a time. This project helped me gain new design skills, especially in organizing visual elements and logical functions to work together smoothly. I learned how important it is to plan structure before coding so that I can avoid confusion later. My design process usually follows a pattern of planning, creating, testing, and refining. I sketch out ideas mentally or on paper, write the code, and then test small parts before moving forward. These tactics, especially the habit of testing as I go, will definitely help me in future projects because it keeps errors down and improves my efficiency.
2. When developing programs, I approach the work with patience and focus on step-by-step problem-solving.  While working on my 3D scene, I learned to troubleshoot issues by isolating problems and making small fixes instead of rewriting everything. Making sure I pay attention and take my time so i spot any mistakes.  Over time, my approach to coding has evolved, I have became more confident with debugging and more aware of how my functions interact with each other. I also learned how to better organize my code for readability and long-term maintenance. Im grateful for this class as it took me out my comfort zone and helped me grow.
3. Computer science plays a big part in helping me reach my goals because it builds both technical and problem-solving skills. Learning computational graphics and visualizations gave me new knowledge about how visuals and logic connect in software development. It taught me how to turn abstract ideas into visible results on the screen, which boosted my confidence in applying theory to practice. These skills are useful not only in my education but also in my future career because they show how programming can create interactive and engaging experiences. In a professional setting, understanding how to visualize data and create user-focused programs will help me in a variety of roles. I really learned how to take my thinking to another level in this class.
